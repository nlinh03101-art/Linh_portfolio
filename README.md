# Linh_portfolio
Portfolio of machine learning and data analytics projects developed during my MSc, uniting statistical modeling, predictive analysis, and data storytelling to drive data-driven decision optimization. Using R and Python, I build interpretable models and visual narratives that turn complex data into clear, actionable insight.
