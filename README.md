# Linh_portfolio

A curated portfolio of **machine learning** and **data analytics** projects developed during my MSc.  
Each project blends **statistical modeling**, **predictive analysis**, and **data storytelling** to translate complex data into clear, actionable insights.  
Using **R** and **Python**, I build interpretable models that support evidence-based and optimized decision-making.
